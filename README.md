# DSA-CS300

In these projects for my course, the main challenge revolved around effectively managing and organizing course-related data. The aim was to develop a system capable of efficiently loading, organizing, and presenting course information from a file. I approached this problem by focusing on understanding various data structures such as maps, vectors, and string manipulation functions. The understanding of these data structures was crucial as they facilitated efficient storage, sorting, and retrieval of course details. Challenges arose during data parsing and user interface design, but these were mitigated through thorough research and meticulous implementation.

Working on this project significantly broadened my approach to designing software and developing programs. It emphasized the pivotal role of selecting appropriate data structures in optimizing efficiency and performance. This hands-on experience underscored the importance of breaking down tasks into manageable components and employing modular design principles. As a result, it enhanced my ability to write clean, readable, and scalable programs. This project solidified the significance of writing code that is easily maintainable, ensuring it remains adaptable to future modifications or extensions.
